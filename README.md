# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

## Introduction

This repo includes my course project to the Coursera 3rd course project named "Getting and Cleaning Data" which is part of the Data Science specialization

I have created a script called run_analysis.R, which contains the code that performs the following:

1. Read all the data required, previously downloaded in the working directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"
2. Make the required transformations to get tidy data
3. Write the output data to a TXT file in the working directory
 
The CodeBook.md has more detailed information about how the script works.

## Run the command below to download the ouput data to your R studio and explore the final output
